This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Load librarires and set working directory

```{r}
library(caret)
library(rpart)
library(randomForest)

set.seed(212121)

setwd('C:\\Users\\Aleksey\\Documents\\School\\coursera\\Practical_Machine_Learning\\Final_Project')
```

Download files (if needed)

```{r}
# Check if the files exist locally, if not - download
training.url <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv"
testing.url <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv"

if(!file.exists("pml-training.csv")) {
    download.file(training.url, "pml-training.csv")
}

if(!file.exists("pml-testing.csv")){
    download.file(testing.url, "pml-testing.csv")
}
```

Load data into memory and cleanup unused variables

```{r}
# Load training and testing data sets
training <- read.csv("pml-training.csv", na.strings = c("NA","", "#DIV/0!"))
testing <- read.csv("pml-testing.csv", na.strings = c("NA","", "#DIV/0!"))

# cleanup unused variables
rm(training.url, testing.url)
```

Prepare train and test data from the testing data set supplied for the assignment

```{r}
# identifying sparsely populated columns using nearZeroVar function
# from testing and training data sets
# Identical changes need to be made to testing and training data sets
to_skip <- nearZeroVar(training)
training <- training[, -to_skip]
testing <- testing[, -to_skip]

# cleanup unused variables
rm(to_skip)

# removing columns containing NA's only
# Identical changes need to be made to testing and training data sets
col_lst <- colSums(is.na(training)) == 0
training <- training[, col_lst]
testing <- testing[, col_lst]

# adjusting data - remove index columns from training and testing data set
training <- training[, -c(1)]
testing <- testing[, -c(1)]

# cleanup unused variables
rm(col_lst)

# Partition data into two two sets - training and testing
# Identical changes need to be made to testing and training data sets
inTrain <- createDataPartition(y=training$classe, p=0.6, list=FALSE)
my_training <- training[inTrain,]
my_testing <- training[-inTrain,]

# cleanup unused variables
rm(inTrain)
```

Generate tree and run prediction. Evaluating the model. Accuracy is around 

```{r}
# Build decision tree model
treeFit <- rpart(classe ~., data=my_training, method="class")
treePredicted <- predict(treeFit, my_testing, type="class")
confusionMatrix(treePredicted, my_testing$classe)
```

Generate Random Forest and run prediction.  Evaluating the model.

```{r}
rfFit <- randomForest(classe ~., data=my_training)
rfPredicted <- predict(rfFit, my_testing, type="class")
confusionMatrix(rfPredicted, my_testing$classe)
```
